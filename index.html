 <h1>T. W. Carson's guide to lookin' at plants real good</h1>
  <p>
    You've reached the landing page for my botanical field notes (if I did this right).  I will continue to update these pages as I explore.  The goal of this site is to provide a simple and accurate -- if massively incomplete -- key for the identification plant species in the California Floristic Province and nearby areas.
  </p> 
  <p>
    With the understanding that closely related species will typically share important morphological similarities, plants in this guide are organized into their established taxonomic clades. Underpinning this design choice is the hope that I'll provide reasonable descriptions of the relevant morphological similarities for each clade, allowing a user to work from the tpo of the taxonomic hierarchy down to the species level by identifying the distinguishing features of a given specimen.
